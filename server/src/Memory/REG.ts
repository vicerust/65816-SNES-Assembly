When this bit is set, you may enable\n       BG2 on Mode 7. BG2 uses the same tile and character data as BG1,\n       but interprets the high bit of the color data as a priority for the\n       pixel.\n\n       Various sources report additional effects for this bit, possibly\n       related to bit 7. For example, \"Enable the Data Supplied From the\n       External Lsi.\", whatever that means. Of course, maybe that's a\n       typo and it's supposed to apply to bit 7 instead.\n\n   p    = Enable pseudo-hires mode. This creates a 512-pixel horizontal\n       resolution by taking pixels from the subscreen for the\n       even-numbered pixels (zero based) and from the main screen for the\n       odd-numbered pixels. Color math behaves just as with Mode 5/6\n       hires. The interlace bit still has no effect. Mosaic operates as\n       normal (not like Mode 5/6). The 'subscreen' pixel is clipped (by\n       windows) when the main-screen pixel to the LEFT is clipped, not\n       when the one to the RIGHT is clipped as you'd expect. What happens\n       with pixel column 0 is unknown.\n\n       Enabling this bit in Modes 5 or 6 has no effect.\n\n   o    = Overscan mode. When set, 239 lines will be displayed instead of\n       the normal 224. This also means V-Blank will occur that\n       much later, and be shorter. All that happens is that extra lines\n       get added to the display, and it seems the TV will like to move\n       the display up 8 pixels. See below for more details.\n\n   I    = OBJ Interlace. When set regardless of BG mode, the OBJ will be\n       interlaced (see bit 0 below), and thus will appear half-height.\n\n       Note that this only controls whether obj are drawn as normal or\n       not; the interlace signal is only output to the TV based on bit 0\n       below.\n\n   i    = Screen interlace. When set in BG mode 5 (and probably 6), the\n       effective screen height will be 448 (or 478) pixles, rather than\n       224 (or 239). When set in any other mode, the screen will just get\n       a bit jumpy. However, toggling the tilemap each field would\n       simulate the increased screen height (much like pseudo-hires\n       simulares hires).\n\n       In hardware, setting this bit makes the SNES output a normal\n       interlace signal rather than always forcing one frame.\n\n   See the sections \"BACKGROUNDS\" and \"SPRITES\" below for details.\n\n   Overscan: The bit only matters at the very end of the frame, if you\n   change the setting on line 0xE0 before the normal NMI trigger point\n   then it's the same as if you had it on all frame. Note that this\n   affects both the NMI trigger point and when HDMA stops for the\n   frame.\n\n   If you turn the bit off at the very beginning of scanline X (for\n   0xE1<=X<=0xF0), NMI will occur on line X and the last HDMA transfer\n   will occur on line X-1. However, on my TV at least, the display will\n   remain in the normal no-overscan position for lines E1-EC, it will\n   move up only one pixel for line ED, and it will lose vertical sync\n   for lines EF-F4!\n\n   Turning the bit on, only line E1 gives any effect: NMI will occur on\n   line E2, although the last HDMA will still occur on line E0.\n   Anything else acts like you left the bit off the whole time. Note,\n   however, that if you wait too long after the beginning of the\n   scanline then you will get no effect.\n\n   Even if there is no visible effect, the overscan setting still\n   affects VRAM writes. In particular, executing \"LDA #'-' / STA $2118\n   / LDA r2133 / STA $2133 / LDA #'+' / STA $2118\" during the E1-F0\n   period will write only + or only - to VRAM, depending on whether the\n   overscan bit was set to 0 or 1."},{"address":"$2134","length":"3 bytes.
